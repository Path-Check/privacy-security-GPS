# privacy-security

We believe that transparency in our software is an important part of ensuring security and privacy. This repository is meant to provide a public place for open source software developers, interested security and privacy experts to go to understand Path Check's:

* Principles relating to security and privacy.  A list of concrete, technical, verifiable privacy principles and tests that developers should build into Safe Paths and Safe Places, and testers should verify.
* Test reports relating to Security and Privacy.
* External test reports related to our adherence to security and privacy (i.e. static code analysis).
* Issues relating to deviations from our Principles referenced above and known external standards.
* Related documents, such as Data Privacy Impact Assessments

This document should be considered the guiding requirements that Path Check Inc expects to implement, and will verify against.
