# Introduction

This document makes heavy use of the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) project.  It is best read in conjuction with the OWASP deliverables that explain acronyms, reference test procedures, and provide a glossary.  Where a test result is recorded against a principle, the icon links to a test or issue report.

## Safe Paths

### OWASP Principles
The following principles have been derived from [OWASP principles applicable to mobile applications](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-security-testing-guide/), and applicable to the Safe Paths app:

* MSTG-ARCH-1 All app components are identified and known to be needed.
* MSTG-ARCH-2 Security controls are never enforced only on the client side, but on the respective remote endpoints.
* MSTG-ARCH-3 A high-level architecture for the mobile app and all connected remote services has been defined and security has been addressed in that architecture
* MSTG-ARCH-4 Data considered sensitive in the context of the mobile app is clearly identified.
* MSTG-ARCH-5 All app components are defined in terms of the business functions and/or security functions they provide.
* MSTG-ARCH-6 A threat model for the mobile app and the associated remote services has been produced that identifies potential threats and countermeasures.
* MSTG-ARCH-8 There is an explicit policy for how cryptographic keys (if any) are managed, and the lifecycle of cryptographic keys is enforced. Ideally, follow a key management standard such as NIST SP 800-57.
* MSTG-ARCH-10 Security is addressed within all parts of the software development lifecycle.
* MSTG-CRYPTO-1 The app does not rely on symmetric cryptography with hardcoded keys as a sole method of encryption.
* MSTG-CRYPTO-2 The app uses proven implementations of cryptographic primitives.
* MSTG-CRYPTO-3 The app uses cryptographic primitives that are appropriate for the particular use-case, configured with parameters that adhere to industry best practices.
* MSTG-CRYPTO-4 The app does not use cryptographic protocols or algorithms that are widely considered deprecated for security purposes.
* MSTG-CRYPTO-5 The app doesn’t re-use the same cryptographic key for multiple purposes.
* MSTG-CRYPTO-6 All random values are generated using a sufficiently secure random number generator.
* MSTG-NETWORK-1 Data is encrypted on the network using Transport Level Security (TLS). The secure channel is used consistently throughout the app.
* MSTG-NETWORK-2 The TLS settings are in line with current best practices, or as close as possible if the mobile operating system does not support the recommended standards.
* MSTG-NETWORK-3 The app verifies the X.509 certificate of the remote endpoint when the secure channel is established. Only certificates signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) are accepted.
* MSTG-NETWORK-6 The app only depends on up-to-date connectivity and security libraries.
* MSTG-PLATFORM-1 The app only requests the minimum set of permissions necessary
* MSTG-PLATFORM-2 All inputs from external sources and the user are validated and if necessary sanitized. This includes data received via the User Interface (UI), Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanisms such as intents, custom Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), and network sources.
* MSTG-PLATFORM-3 The app does not export sensitive functionality via custom URL schemes, unless these mechanisms are properly protected.
* MSTG-PLATFORM-4 The app does not export sensitive functionality through IPC facilities, unless these mechanisms are properly protected.
* MSTG-PLATFORM-5 JavaScript is disabled in WebViews unless explicitly required.
* MSTG-PLATFORM-6 WebViews are configured to allow only the minimum set of protocol handlers required (ideally, only https is supported). Potentially dangerous handlers, such as file, tel and app-id, are disabled.
* MSTG-PLATFORM-7 If native methods of the app are exposed to a WebView, verify that the WebView only renders JavaScript contained within the app package.
* WebView should not have debugging mode enabled in the App release.
* MSTG-PLATFORM-8 Object deserialization, if any, is implemented using safe serialization Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).
* MSTG-CODE-1 The app is signed and provisioned with a valid certificate, of which the private key is properly protected.
* MSTG-CODE-2 The app has been built in release mode, with settings appropriate for a release build (e.g. non-debuggable).
* MSTG-CODE-3 Debugging symbols have been removed from native binaries.
* MSTG-CODE-4 Debugging code and developer assistance code (e.g. test code, backdoors, hidden settings) have been removed. The app does not log verbose errors or debugging messages.
* MSTG-CODE-5 All third party components used by the mobile app, such as libraries and frameworks, are identified, and checked for known vulnerabilities.
* MSTG-CODE-6 The app catches and handles possible exceptions.
* MSTG-CODE-7 Error handling logic in security controls denies access by default.
* MSTG-CODE-8 In unmanaged code, memory is allocated, freed and used securely.
* MSTG-CODE-9 Free security features offered by the toolchain, such as byte-code minification, stack protection, Position Independent Executable (PIE) support and automatic reference counting, are activated.

* MSTG-STORAGE-9: The app removes sensitive data from views when moved to the background.  [![PASS](../images/pass.png?raw=true)](../dynamic_testing/MSTSG_STORAGE.md)
* MSTG-STORAGE-10 The app does not hold sensitive data in memory longer than necessary, and memory is cleared explicitly after use.
* At startup, rooting should be checked for in order to protect user devices against being controlled by malicious software and their personal data accessed.  If rooting is found, the user should be notified of the specific risk.
* Data should not be stored in files in plaintext at any point

* Verify that the application does not include and execute functionality from untrusted sources, such as unverified content distribution networks, JavaScript libraries, node npm libraries, or server-side DLLs.

#### 12.4 File Storage Requirements
* Verify that files obtained from untrusted sources are stored outside the web root, with limited permissions, preferably with strong validation.
* Verify that files obtained from untrusted sources are scanned by antivirus scanners to prevent upload of known malicious content.

#### 12.5 File Download Requirements
* Verify that the web tier is configured to serve only files with specific file extensions to prevent unintentional information and source code leakage. For
example, backup files (e.g. .bak), temporary working files (e.g. .swp), compressed files (.zip, .tar.gz, etc) and other extensions commonly used by editors should be blocked unless required.  __note this should form guidance to HAs, rather than implemented configuration__
* Verify that direct requests to uploaded files will never be executed as HTML/JavaScript content.

#### 13.1 Generic Web Service Security Verification Requirements
* Verify that all application components use the same encodings and parsers to avoid parsing attacks that exploit different URI or file parsing behavior that could be used in SSRF and RFI attacks.
* Verify that access to administration and management functions is limited to authorized administrators.
* Verify API URLs do not expose sensitive information, such as the API key, session tokens etc.
* Verify that authorization decisions are made at both the URI, enforced by programmatic or declarative security at the controller or router, and at the
resource level, enforced by model-based permissions.
* Verify that requests containing unexpected or missing content types are rejected with appropriate headers (HTTP response status 406 Unacceptable or 415
Unsupported Media Type).

#### 13.2 RESTful Web Service Verification Requirements
* Verify that enabled RESTful HTTP methods are a valid choice for the user or action, such as preventing normal users using DELETE or PUT on protected API or
resources.
* Verify that JSON schema validation is in place and verified before accepting input.
* Verify that RESTful web services that utilize cookies are protected from Cross-Site Request Forgery via the use of at least one or more of the following: triple or double submit cookie pattern (see references), CSRF nonces, or ORIGIN request header checks.
* Verify that REST services have anti-automation controls to protect against excessive calls, especially if the API is unauthenticated.
* Verify that REST services explicitly check the incoming Content-Type to be the expected one, such as application/xml or application/JSON.
* Verify that the message headers and payload are trustworthy and not modified in transit. Requiring strong encryption for transport (TLS only) may be sufficient in many cases as it provides both confidentiality and integrity protection. Per-message digital signatures can provide additional assurance on top of the transport protections for high-security applications but bring with them additional complexity and risks to weigh against the benefits.

#### 13.4 GraphQL and other Web Service Data Layer Security Requirements
* Verify that query whitelisting or a combination of depth limiting and amount limiting should be used to prevent GraphQL or data layer expression denial of
service (DoS) as a result of expensive, nested queries. For more advanced scenarios, query cost analysis should be used.
* Verify that GraphQL or other data layer authorization logic should be implemented at the business logic layer instead of the GraphQL layer.

#### 14.2 Dependency
* Verify that all components are up to date, preferably using a dependency checker during build or compile time.
* Verify that all unneeded features, documentation, samples, configurations are removed, such as sample applications, platform documentation, and default or
example users.
* Verify that if application assets, such as JavaScript libraries, CSS stylesheets or web fonts, are hosted externally on a content delivery network (CDN) or external provider, Subresource Integrity (SRI) is used to validate the integrity of the asset.
* Verify that third party components come from pre-defined, trusted and continually maintained repositories.
* Verify that an inventory catalog is maintained of all third party libraries in use.
* Verify that the attack surface is reduced by sandboxing or encapsulating third party libraries to expose only the required behaviour into the application.

#### 14.3 Unintended Security Disclosure Requirements
* Verify that web or application server and framework error messages are configured to deliver user actionable, customized responses to eliminate any
unintended security disclosures
* Verify that web or application server and application framework debug modes are disabled in production to eliminate debug features, developer consoles, and
unintended security disclosures [![PARTIALLY TRUE](../images/partial.png?raw=true)](https://pathcheck.atlassian.net/browse/PLACES-272)
* Verify that the HTTP headers or any part of the HTTP response do not expose detailed version information of system components
* Verify that every HTTP response contains a content type header specifying a safe character set (e.g., UTF-8, ISO 8859-1)
* Verify that all API responses contain Content-Disposition: attachment;filename="api.json" (or other appropriate filename for the content type).
* Verify that a content security policy (CSPv2) is in place that helps mitigate impact for XSS attacks like HTML, DOM, JSON, and JavaScript injection vulnerabilities.
* Verify that all responses contain X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff. [![PARTIALLY TRUE](../images/partial.png?raw=true)](https://pathcheck.atlassian.net/browse/PLACES-272)
* Verify that HTTP Strict Transport Security headers are included on all responses and for all subdomains, such as Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=15724800;includeSubdomains [![PARTIALLY TRUE](../images/partial.png?raw=true)](https://pathcheck.atlassian.net/browse/PLACES-272)
* Verify that a suitable "Referrer-Policy" header is included, such as "no-referrer" or "same-origin" [![PARTIALLY TRUE](../images/partial.png?raw=true)](https://pathcheck.atlassian.net/browse/PLACES-272)
* Verify that a suitable X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors header is in use for sites where content should not be embedded in a
third-party site [![PARTIALLY TRUE](../images/partial.png?raw=true)](https://pathcheck.atlassian.net/browse/PLACES-272)
