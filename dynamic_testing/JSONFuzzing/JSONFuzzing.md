# OWASP principles in scope
Verify that all input (HTML form fields, REST requests, URL parameters, HTTP headers, cookies, batch files, RSS feeds, etc) is validated using positive validation (whitelisting).
# Endpoints in scope

* Safeplaces facing /login API endpoint, and endpoint to get a new access-code
* Public endpoint API for uploading location data

# Purpose of test
This test was to provide some assurance that these key endpoints are not vulnerable to JSON injection.  

The end-points were selected as they are accessible to someone reverse engineering the mobile application, and a contact tracer working inside a healthcare authority, and represent the only data entry point to the Safe Places system in the current release.  

The existence of a vulnerabilty may mean that bad data can be injected, existing data can be compromised, or the system can be otherwise subverted at the application code level.

The actual payloads for the attacks were based on a list of known JSON attacks from fuzzdb.

The tests require pytest, and can be run by adding "test_" to the start of the methods name in test_fuzzing.py.  For example, changing "happy_path" to "test_happy_path", then running pytest in this folder, will execute a happy path test.

# Test results
* The login endpoint was not tested with SQL injection as it relies on LDAP, and that is a test server not a recommended implementation
* The access-code endpoint was tested to ensure that if any fuzz example was sent, an access code was still provided (as the POST payload is not used).  This test failed as 4xx errors were seen.  [See jira.}(https://pathcheck.atlassian.net/browse/PLACES-423?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNDNjYmIyMTEwN2Q1NDBlNjg3YWFmZTU4YmM0NjExYWUiLCJwIjoiaiJ9).  This does not mean the application is necessarily vulnerable.
* The upload endpoint was tested to ensure that fuzz data was not propogated into the solution.  In some instances the data was accepted (2xx response), and I checked in the UI that out of all the posted fuzz examples, only one actually ended up inside the database (and accessible through the UI), and this was simply empty, rather than holding corrupt data

# Further testing
This covers a JSON payload on some priority interfaces, but not all of them.
